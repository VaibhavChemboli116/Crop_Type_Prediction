# CropTypePrediction Project

Welcome to the Crop Type Prediction project! In this project, we employed various machine learning algorithms and deep learning architectures to predict crop types based on given features.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the type of crop based on several input features. Predicting crop types accurately can aid farmers and agricultural organizations in making informed decisions about crop planning, resource allocation, and yield optimization. We explored multiple machine learning and deep learning techniques to develop robust predictive models. We have used randomized search for optimizing parameters to bring best out of every algorithm.
